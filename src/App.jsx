This is meant to demonstrate the importance of these seemingly invisible responses that the system sends to the users. Continuity is represented by smooth scrolling, and a shift is demonstrated by a jump so sections switch horizontally but continue vertically. Hovering on a paragraph foregrounds it and guides the attention to focus on the article. There are markers that situate the reader linearly in a text: The constant presence of the heading and paragraph numbers are metacues for orientation. ",
