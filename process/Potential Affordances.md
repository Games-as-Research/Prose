# Digital-First Affordances 

*What change can I introduce to digital reading that will change the way people read/engage with/learn from, research papers"*

1. [[#Links]] 
2. Hover
	1. Citations on Hover 
	2. Footnotes on Hover 
3. Annotations exporting 
4. Section Breaks
	1. Instead of pages, section based demarcations could be more useful now that we don't have constraints of printing paper and carrying paper.
5. Presentation based on **purposes of reading**
	1. Skimming 
	2. Surface read
	3. Deep read
	4. Repeat reading 
6. Custom print form 
	1. If the user wants to print they should be able to print it in a form as they prefer 
	2. What is the "quanta" of a paper? What should the user be able to move around? A character? Word? Line? Lines? Paragraph(s)? Section?  
	3. Changing words? Summaries, *your* summaries
7. Jargon Dictionary
8. Searching 
	1. Word occurrences 
	2. Searching and jumping back 
9. Recompiling a repo for software-based projects 
10. Annotating papers, journals, assets, and exporting these annotations as notes, and notes that can then be loaded back in. Exporting these in a way that they can be read on their own but also can be imported back in. 
11. Visualization for mathematical models and machine learning models 
12. Dynamic Switching and compiling between playable builds for games (watching a game's design materialize over commits)
13. Another example is that if a tool could take an existing PDF and break it down into parts, allow the user to move these parts around
14. E-Reading must afford re-reading, deep reading, quick referencing -- and all of this could be done with a hi-fidelity user interface. 
15. Layers
	1. Like photoshop, layers can be added on top of text that allow notes on top of the article, rewriting the article 
16. A concept-graph where each node is manually placed in the text to put the article 
17. Metadata Queues (Liquid text, Tashman, 2011)
	1. The base form needs to provide these for the reader. 
18. Multiple windows placement 
19. Word pointer to guide my eyes as I read 



### Links 
- When research papers are being read, there is some back and forth of concepts, you need to revisit things, it is non-linear the way you engage with things.
- Computers can jump between things, these things in this can be 
	- keywords,
	- concepts, 
	- jargon, 
	- acronyms 
- I can see a graph being implemented underneath the text that can take people from one to the other, as they desire
- **And take them there in a way that doesn't cause such severe whiplash.**
	- Links to citations, 
	- Hyperlinks to other pages 
	- Foot/notes
- Take for example reading articles on Wikipedia. 
	- Wikipedia is notorious for being opaque in terms of language, other concepts it links to, maybe Im just starting out but if I start reading a page on Tidal Forces for instance, I need to understand gravity on the planetary scale, I need to understand the space-time continuum, I need to understand frames of reference, angular velocity, acceleration, and more. 
	- All of these concepts *are* linked as hyperlinks -- thank god for the web architecture -- but they were not very inviting because if you click on one of them, you go over to the wikipedia page for angular momentum and now that itself comes with a whole set of jargon; its like falling down the rabbit hole, never to crawl out 
	- But then wikipedia implemented the "glance on hover" feature where if you hover over the link you get some description and maybe the main picture if it exists, that gives you just enough information to make sense of what you're reading, and the ability to make the decision if you are understanding enough to dive deep or stop here. 
	- The "glance on hover" feature invites the user to have a peak, and decide if this is even necessary for the information they really need, and proceed productively. 
	- It enables productive use of reading
